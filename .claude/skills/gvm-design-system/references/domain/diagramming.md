**Activation signals:** Always active when diagrams are being created. Every spec that contains a diagram triggers this specialist.

**Key principles from the theoretical foundations:**

- **Purchase's aesthetics hierarchy** (empirical research): Edge crossings are the strongest predictor of diagram comprehension errors. Minimising crossings matters more than minimising bends, which matters more than symmetry. Layout priority: (1) minimise crossings, (2) minimise bends, (3) maximise symmetry, (4) minimise area.
- **Orthogonal routing** (Di Battista et al.): Connectors should use horizontal and vertical segments only (orthogonal routing). Diagonal lines are harder to trace visually. Route connectors around obstacles, not through them.
- **Preattentive processing** (Ware, Ch. 5): Colour, size, orientation, and motion are processed preattentively (before conscious attention). Use these channels deliberately — a red box is noticed before a label is read. Don't waste preattentive channels on decoration.
- **Gestalt grouping** (Ware, Ch. 6): Elements that are close together are perceived as a group (proximity). Elements that look similar are perceived as related (similarity). Use spatial grouping and consistent visual style to convey architectural boundaries.

**Key principles from the practical experts:**

- **Smallest effective difference** (Tufte, *Envisioning Information*): Use the minimum visual distinction necessary to convey meaning. Don't use thick borders when thin ones suffice. Don't use colour where position already conveys the relationship.
- **No chartjunk in diagrams** (Tufte): No decorative shadows, gradients, 3D effects, or ornamental elements. Every pixel should convey information.
- **Layered information** (Tufte, *Visual Explanations*): Diagrams should work at multiple zoom levels — overview at a glance, detail on inspection. Use colour coding, line styles, and annotations for layers.
- **Only the diagrams that matter** (Fowler, *UML Distilled*, Ch. 1): Don't create diagrams for everything. A diagram should exist only when it communicates something that prose cannot. Fowler: "The most important thing about diagrams is that they should be useful."
- **Enough detail, no more** (Fowler, *UML Distilled*, Ch. 2-3): Show the relevant attributes and relationships, not every field. A diagram that shows everything shows nothing.

**Diagram review checklist (apply after every diagram is created):**

**Layout & Topology (checks 1–5):**

1. **No connector-box intersections** — trace every connector path segment against every box boundary mathematically, not by eyeballing. For each path segment, verify the x,y coordinates do not pass through any box's x-range AND y-range simultaneously. Orthogonal routing eliminates most issues — diagonal connectors are the primary source of accidental intersections. If a connector must cross another connector, mark the crossing clearly (gap or bridge).
2. **Hub nodes at centre** — if one node has significantly more connections than others (3+), place it centrally and arrange connected nodes radially around it (Purchase: radial layouts for star topologies). Do not force a hub node into a linear flowchart position — it creates congestion on one side.
3. **Each connection exits a different side of hub nodes** — when a box has multiple outgoing connections, they should exit from different sides or at least different positions on the same side. Never have multiple connectors emerging from the same point. This is the primary cause of visual congestion and apparent crossings.
4. **Minimal crossings** — if two connectors cross, the box positions are wrong. Rearrange boxes first, don't just reroute connectors. Per Purchase: crossing minimisation is the #1 predictor of diagram readability, more important than any other aesthetic.
5. **Orthogonal routing** — all connectors use horizontal and vertical segments only (Di Battista et al.). No diagonal connectors except for simple, short, unambiguous direct connections with no other connectors nearby. Orthogonal connectors are easier to trace and less likely to create visual ambiguity about which boxes they connect.

**Spatial Organisation (checks 6–8):**

6. **Consistent flow direction** — information should flow in one primary direction (top-to-bottom or left-to-right). Feedback/return paths flow in the opposite direction and should be visually distinct (dashed, different colour). Don't mix primary flow directions.
7. **Aligned elements** — boxes at the same logical level should share a common baseline. Use consistent spacing between rows/columns. Uneven spacing creates false grouping signals (Ware: Gestalt proximity).
8. **Connectors don't overlap** — two connectors should not share the same visual space for any significant length. If two connectors must run parallel, offset them by at least 10px. Overlapping connectors look like a single line and hide relationships.

**Labels & Notation (checks 9–12):**

9. **Readable text at rendered size — applies to ALL diagram text, not just connector/entity labels.** SVG `font-size` is in viewBox units; the rendered pixel size depends on the figure's container width. The formula:

   ```
   effective_px = svg_font_size × (rendered_width_px / viewBox_width)
   ```

   Example: a `font-size="14"` label inside `viewBox="0 0 1100 600"` rendered at `max-width: 800px` → effective `14 × (800/1100) ≈ 10px`. Below the floor.

   Floors (test at the figure's `max-width`):
   - **Body text inside cells / quadrant content / chart labels:** ≥ 14px effective
   - **Section / quadrant titles:** ≥ 18px effective (match body-text reading scale)
   - **Axis labels, legends, tick labels:** ≥ 13px effective
   - **Connector labels, entity/state names:** ≥ 12px effective

   If text falls below floor, the fix is one of: bump `font-size` in the SVG, widen the figure's `max-width`, or cut redundant text to free space (see rule 17). Do not ship a figure where the cell content reads smaller than the surrounding body prose.
10. **Labels on straight segments, not corners** — position connector labels on the midpoint of a straight segment, never at a bend/corner where they overlap the turn and become ambiguous about which connector they describe.
11. **No label-label overlaps** — check every label's bounding box against every other label. Two labels must not occupy the same visual space even partially. Common where connectors run close together (e.g., a forward transition label overlapping a nearby resume path label). Fix by repositioning along the connector or shifting perpendicular.

    **Same diagnostic, broader scope: no label-vs-box overlaps either** (Purchase: label readability is load-bearing; labels overlapping background elements degrade comprehension equally to label-vs-label overlaps). Compute every label's bounding box (text width ≈ character count × font-size × 0.55 for Palatino/Georgia at typical weights, height ≈ font-size × 1.2). Verify the bounding box does not intersect any rect, path, or other text element except its own connector line. Connector arrow labels in particular are at risk: a label centred at the connector's midpoint may extend past the connector's start/end and overlap the boxes it connects. Fix by shortening the label, shifting it perpendicular to the connector (above/below for horizontal connectors, left/right for vertical), or widening the gap between boxes.
12. **Consistent notation with legend** — same line style means the same type of relationship throughout. If the diagram uses more than one line style, colour, or dash pattern, include a legend. Don't rely on the caption alone — the legend should be inside the SVG.
13. **Caption** — every diagram has a figure number and descriptive caption below it. Reference the design rationale where applicable (e.g., "Purchase: radial layout for hub nodes").

**Overall Quality (checks 14–16):**

14. **Colour conveys meaning, not decoration** — if colour is used, it must encode information (e.g., status states, risk levels, domain boundaries). Every colour used must appear in the legend or caption. Don't use colour for visual interest alone.
15. **Self-contained** — the diagram must be understandable without reading the surrounding text. A colleague who sees only the diagram should understand the structure.
16. **Size proportional to complexity** — a 3-entity ERD doesn't need 800px width. A 10-entity ERD does. Scale to content. But err on the side of more space — cramped diagrams cause all the other problems (crossings, overlaps, small labels).
17. **Cut redundant labels** (Doumont — *Trees, Maps, and Theorems*: maximise signal, minimise noise; introduce-once-then-use). If axis labels already convey orientation, do not repeat the orientation inside every cell. If a quadrant diagram has axes labelled "Built well / Built badly" and "Right thing / Wrong thing", do not also italicise "Wrong thing, built well" inside each cell — it's the same information twice in the same eyeful. Cut the redundant labels and use the freed vertical space to enlarge the cell's primary content (per rule 9). The same applies to repeating the figure's title inside every panel of a small-multiples grid, repeating axis units inside every chart label, and any other label that the figure's frame already establishes.
18. **When the cells contain prose, it is not a table — it is a figure done wrong.** (Few — *Show Me the Numbers*: tables for precise lookup of values; charts and figures for relationships and qualitative comparison.) An HTML `<table>` whose cells contain full sentences with em-dashes, italics, and qualifiers is a comparison figure pretending to be a table. The diagnostic: can a reader use this table to look up a precise value? If no, it is the wrong format. Replace with a small-multiples figure, a paired-comparison diagram, or — most often — cut the table entirely because the surrounding prose already carries the comparison and the table is duplicate ink.
